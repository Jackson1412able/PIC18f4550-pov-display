# PIC18f4550-pov-display

This repository is created to share the code of my project, which is a PIC18F4550 Persistence of Vision (POV) display.
This project was created as a birthday gift to my girlfriend.

Persistence of vision works in such a way that the human eye and brain can only process 10 to 12 images in a second. If fast moving
images move up to this speed, it will create an optical illusion of continuity of the fast moving images.

The picture below shows the board with the entire circuit mounted on it. The board is then mounted on the end of the electric fan shaft
by replacing the blades of the fan.

### Several pictures below show the testing of the POV display with some random texts.
